						Hello! I'm Robby Gardner. I am a small independent web developer. I do some design work, but I mainly use the code to my advantage to make the best web page possible. 
						I live in Cleveland, Ohio and do independent contracting for web pages. I am originally from Grand Rapids, Michigan where my bachelor degree in Computer Information 
						Systems was accomplished. I've been working in the IT world for little over six years in the customer support/technical analyst. Small business sites are what I 
						specialize in, as I have attracted business professionals of start-ups for knowing how to get their point across to their consumers.
						</p>
						<p>
						I have been working to obtain a masters degree to further my advancement in coding. I have used jquery/javascript/html5/html/css/css3. I like to experiment with my code 
						to come up with designs on my own as I pull from different resources and have been working with web-hosting from home as well as remote for a while.
						</p>
						<p>
						I'm familiarized with marketing information as I know what it takes for a business to get its name out there. I am able to quickly and efficiently code as I have enough 
						spare time to come up with a design that fits your needs. If you need more information please feel free to <a href="Contact/contact-pop.php"><b>contact</b> </a> me via my form 
						or give me a call at: (216) 220-0268. Look forward to hearing from you!
